    <p><i>Author: </i>Herman Melville</p>
    <p><i>Rating: </i>4/5</p>
    <p><i>Summary: </i>Moby-Dick is more than the story of a boy on-board a whaling ship, more than an ode to marine lore and legend, and even more than a metaphysical allegory for the struggle between good and evil. Herman Melville’s “Great American Novel” is a masterful study of faith, obsession, and delusion — and a profound social commentary born from his lifelong meditation on America. The result will fill you with wonder and awe.</p>

    <p><i>Author: </i>Umberto Eco</p>
    <p><i>Rating: </i>4.5/5</p>
    <p><i>Summary: </i>Originally published in Italian, The Name of the Rose is one of the bestselling books of all time — and for good reason. Umberto Eco plots a wild ride from start to finish: an intelligent murder mystery that combines theology, semiotics, empiricism, biblical analysis, and layers of metanarratives that create a brilliant labyrinth of a book.</p>
